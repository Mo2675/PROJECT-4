Overview
You will be completing a scavenger hunt app. This app has a list which requires the user to attach photos based on the task. After attaching the photo to a task, the app shows the user where that photo was taken in a map.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
By the end of this assignment you will be able to...

Use PHPicker to select photos and get photo data from the photo library
Use MapKit to display custom annotations on a map
Required Features
Task List Screen
Users should be able to view a list of tasks to be completed
For simplicity, you can create your own hardcoded Task data models
Users should be able to tap into a task and be navigated to the task detail screen
Tasks that have been completed should be visually distinguished (see task detail view)
Task Detail Screen
Users should be able to view the title, description, and possibly the attached photo of the task
Users should be able to attach a photo to the task
Doing this marks the task as completed with a visual indicator and shows the location of the photo inside of the map
The completed indicator should also be visible in the task list
After completing the task on detail view, the list page should reflect it was completed
Stretch Features
Give the user the option to open the camera instead of choosing from the photo library
Use the UIImagePickerController class to show the camera. You will need to build to device in order to test this.
Note: You can also use this class to open the photo library. However that will be deprecated soon. You should only be using UIImagePickerController to present the camera.
Resources
MapKit
PHPicker
ðŸ’¡ Hints
I cannot get the location data from a photo.

Make sure you're selecting a photo that actually has location metadata. Also, make sure that the user has granted full access to the photo library.

Make sure to include the NSCameraUsageDescription key in your appâ€™s Info.plist file similar to what was done in lab.
